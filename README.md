Used Spherical Trigonometry as this seems the method that Google Map adopted: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry.



Decimal Degree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees.

According to Google Map, the distance from London [51.509865,-0.118092] to Huddersfiled Station [53.648557, -1.784449] is 263.10 km (163.48 mi)

I checked the consistancy between the distance calculated by the formula and the one from Google Map.

The calc result = 263.10 km
Google Map = 263.10 km
